Complete the function that takes 3 numbers x, y and k (where x ≤ y), and returns the number of integers within the range [x..y] (both ends included) that are divisible by k.

More scientifically: { i : x ≤ i ≤ y, i mod k = 0 }

Example
Given x = 6, y = 11, k = 2 the function should return 3, because there are three numbers divisible by 2 between 6 and 11: 6, 8, 10
