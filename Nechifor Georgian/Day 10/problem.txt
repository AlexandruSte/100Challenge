You are given a non-null array of integers. Implement the method arrayToTree which creates a binary tree from its values in accordance to their order, while creating nodes by depth from left to right.

For example, given the array [17, 0, -4, 3, 15] you should create the following tree:

    17
   /  \
  0   -4
 / \
3   15
