The number 1089 is the smallest one, non palindromic, that has the same prime factors that its reversal. Thus,

prime factorization of 1089 with 3, 3, 11, 11 -------> 3, 11

prime factorization of 9801 with  3, 3, 3, 3, 11, 11 -------> 3, 11
The task for this kata is to create a function same_factRev(), that receives a nMax, to find all the numbers with the above property, bellow nMax.

the function same_factRev(), will output a sorted list with the found numbers bellow nMax

Let'se some cases

same_factRev(1100) -----> [1089]

same_factRev(2500) -----> [1089, 2178]
(Palindromic numbers are like: 171, 454, 4224, these ones should be discarded)
