/*A student signed up for n workshops and wants to attend the maximum number of workshops where no two workshops overlap. 
You must do the following:
Implement 2 structures:
1. struct Workshop having the following members:
    The workshop's start time.
    The workshop's duration.
    The workshop's end time.
2. struct Available_Workshops having the following members:
    An integer, n(the number of workshops the student signed up for).
    An array of type Workshop array having size n.

Implemen 2 functions:
1. Available_Workshops* initialize (int start_time[], int duration[], int n) 
    Creates an Available_Workshops object and initializes its elements using the elements in the 
    start_time[] and duration[] parameters(both are of size n). Here, start_time[i] and duration[i]
    are the respective start time and duration for the i-th workshop. This function must return a pointer to an Available_Workshops object.
2. int CalculateMaxWorkshops(Available_Workshops* ptr) 
    Returns the maximum number of workshops the student can attendâ€”without overlap. 
    The next workshop cannot be attended until the previous workshop ends
